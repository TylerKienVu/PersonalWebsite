				        User interviews gave me a good place to start in terms of figuring out what I should prioritize with my time in order to get the best user experience possible. I asked questions like "What makes a website 'good' to you?" and "What would you look for on a personal website as a hiring manager?". What I concluded from the responses was that people wanted simple, intuitive, and cohesive design with strong influential content.

				      	A Competitor Analysis is the the process of researching similar products in order to know what features are a must have and what features could be added to make your product unique. I made sure to analyze front end web developer portfolios to get a good idea on the standard I would need to reach in order to be at the level I want. I took note of design decisions that grabbed my attention and tried to apply it to my own portfolio.

				    	Creating a Feature Value Matrix is the practice of listing all of the design decisions you want to implement and weighing them against each other. The reasoning behind the features I chose goes back to the goal of having a simple, intuitive, and cohesive design.

						A Cognitive Walkthrough is an in person examination of a user's thought process when going through an interface. This process is essential for the success of a design because it reveals many holes that you did not see when originally implementing it. My Cognitive Walkthroughs taught me that people have different mindsets when going through a site in terms of what they look for and how they look for it.

The results surprised me because all the users picked different areas. My second test was a landing page impression test. People seemed to like my old landing page but there was still room for improvement such as including my name.

				      	&emsp;Conducting User Research was a great learning experience because it allowed me to gain insight on what other's wanted from a personal portfolio. I ended up getting alot more information from the interviews than I was expecting. The top 3 things that the users I interviewed wanted from a personal portfolio is simple design, intuitive design, and strong content. The user's desires ended up correlating with my original intentions on what I wanted for my portfolio so I had no issues there. My biggest concern was that I would not design correctly to fit my intentions. I knew that I would probably have to go through many trials and errors to figure out what I feel works the best.
				      	<br><br>
				      	&emsp;The User Testing portion of the project made me rethink my whole design. The User Tests showed that my "First draft" of my portfolio was not as intuitive as I originally thought and that I was missing some extremely basic and essential elements like my name. I got so caught up in the design aspect of the portfolio that I forgot to include basic information. Simply put, my portfolio needed alot more work in every area. The content and design were severely lacking.

						&emsp;When I started creating my "First draft", I tried to tailor the design to fit the information that I got from the User Interviews. I soon realized that with my limited knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, what the users wanted was not an easy goal to accomplish. I had no idea how to make what I was picturing in my head and ended up creating very lack-luster substitutes. I ran into numerous problems that I couldn't figure out for the longest time. But I eventually learned and now, hopefully, I won't make the same mistake twice. The "first draft" of my personal portfolio turned out alright in my opinion given the limited experience I had with front-end web development but it definitely was not enough. 
						<br><br>
						&emsp;After gathering more data from User Testing, it confirmed my doubts that my "First draft" was not where it needed to be. I also had two underlying problems that I had to debate for a while whether I wanted to address. My first problem was that I originally designed my portfolio with Bootstrap 3 but later realized that Bootstrap 4 was much better for what I wanted to do. My second problem was that I designed my portfolio desktop-first which made the queries very clunky to work with. So all that said, I made a very painstaking decision to scratch my old portfolio and create a new one with the updated Bootstrap 4 framework and mobile-first design. The process of adopting the updated framework took me alot more time than I would like to admit but I definitely believe it was worth it. I wanted to make sure that my portfolio was up-to-date because I plan on using it in the future. With the addition of Bootstrap 4 and mobile-first design, things progressed alot more smoothly. I tackled my previous problems of not having strong content and intuitive design and I am happy with the results.
